This is a long-term project for sharing simple and useful seismic processing routines. The goal of this project is to share light routines with minimum dependency that can be easily integrated into many other projects.

- **seisproc_util.py**: Basic signal processing treatments
- **seisproc_fk.py**: fk domain processing
